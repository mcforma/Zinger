#### Introduction:

Due to COVID-19, many people have had to change their routines and life habits. This includes social engagement. Online engagement through social media is becoming more of a modern public square to communicate and share ideas with one another. Furthermore, in recent years, the demand for secure messaging applications has spiked dramatically as awareness of hacking capability has increased. Coming from somewhat of a security background myself, I am interested to learn how to integrate end-to-end encryption in this application.

#### Purpose:

Create a social media application with private messaging capabilities in which users can create posts for their pages and engage with others in the new modern public square. The final product will have MFA and E2EE. Share your thoughts, links, videos, and images with your followers and be able to have conversations. _(This is basically a Twitter clone project)_.
