# Zinger Final Project Review

### 1. Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)

I thought it would be cool to make a Twitter clone when the class started. At this point though I realize that it was well beyond my ability with the amount of time provided to accomplish a project of such scope. As time went on, I just kept trimming and whittling away at what features it would have by the end date. There's not too much left to it now.

### 2. Code and Architecture Walk-Through

### 3. Product Demonstration

### 4. Lessons Learned:

**What did you do right**

My database is functional, and I built it using code first, so that's pretty cool.

**What did you do wrong?**

Well, the biggest mistake I made which had a tremendous domino effect on my project was not choosing an appropriate scope. Looking back now, it seems pretty rediculous to have attempted
to make something as robust as a Twitter clone when I came into this class knowing nothing. At the moment my project is not even technically a MVP, as you cannot see who creates what Zingers and the individualized user home pages have not even begun to be implemented. The layout/UI is very basic. The only thing that is mostly working is Identity. I got hung up on stuff for too long when it wasn't working (e.g. manage user form). At this point the project is very unfinished.

**Where were you lucky?**

I'm not sure there's really a best answer to this question. My database is functional. Identity is mostly complete. I have something to present even though its not really anywhere near what I would have liked. Classmates were very helpful, and without them I probably would have even less done.

**What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?**

I would have chosen a much more simple and smaller project. I also probably should have asked for more help from my peers.

**What is next?**

To be forthright, this project needs to be tabled for a while while I work on other things, after which point I may return to it to make it more as I envisioned.
