1. As a social person, 
I want a way to connect with my friends and family and meet new people
so that we can interact socially when we can’t be together face-to-face (as with COVID-19).
2. As an employee of my company’s marketing division
I need to ensure we have a wide social media presence 
so that we can garner a lot of views for advertisement.
3. As a person who moved to another state to take a job,
I want a way to see my friends and family’s posts and activity in my feed
so that I can stay up to date with them.
4. As an active member in my extended family,
I want a secure way to privately message my family
so that our data is protected and remains in our own control.
